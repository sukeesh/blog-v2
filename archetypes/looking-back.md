Itâ€™s been more than 2 years since I graduated and started working as a Software Engineer at Mercari. I thought of putting down everything I did in the past 2 years after moving to Tokyo, Japan, in September 2018.

<br>

## My Journey at Mercari

The first month was mostly orientation, and at the end of October, I joined the **US@Tokyo** team as a Backend Engineer.

### Initial Days

In the first quarter, I worked on the Home API (Golang) in the Backend team, integrating ML services with the backend and setting up Prometheus and Grafana for ML Services written in Python Flask.

```diff
+ Golang
+ Prometheus
+ Grafana
+ Kubernetes
+ Docker
```

Here are a **few** components I added to Mercari's home screen during my first quarter:

It was rewarding to see my work directly visible on the home screen of the app.

## (Personal) Hackathon in Tokyo

I participated in a hackathon for the first time in Tokyo. The atmosphere was very different compared to India. Here's the link to my [submission for the Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/smart-offline-ads).

## Code.. Code.. Code

In early 2019, I spent most of my time working on the Home screen API, adding several components to the application. One such component gave me experience with the Search backend.

```diff
+ Redis
```

## New Microservice ðŸŽ‰

Later, I started co-creating a new microservice for saved search. This was my first microservice, and my learning curve was exponential.

```diff
+ Microservices
+ Cloud Spanner
```

## (Personal) Kubernetes Enthusiasm

During this time, I also deep-dived into Kubernetes. I spent a lot of my free time reading the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/) core code.

I also started contributing to Kubernetes open source. [Here's how I started contributing to Kubernetes](https://sukeesh.com/blog/2019-08-01/started-kubernetes).

```diff
+ Istio
```

## Second Microservice

In mid-2019, I began working on the Price Suggestion project. This involved designing and developing a backend microservice (in Golang) for a Machine Learning model to suggest a price range when users listed items.

We released several features related to the Price Suggestion project, and I was the initial backend engineer for all of them.

## Payments Team

Parallelly, I briefly worked with the Payments team to implement features for [Mercari GG](https://www.mercari.com/us/digital/).

```diff
+ PHP
```

## (Personal) Kubernetes Job Notifier

![Kubernetes Job Notifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sukeesh/blog/refs/heads/gh-pages/assets/images/aug2020/k8sjob.png)

I created a Slack notifier for Kubernetes cronjob failures/success using Kubernetes API and Slack API. This project received positive feedback from users. [Check out the GitHub repository](https://github.com/sukeesh/k8s-job-notify).

## 2020 Highlights

In early 2020, I worked on various backend projects, including [Mercari Pro Seller](https://www.mercari.com/us/become-a-pro-seller/).

```diff
+ BigQuery
```

---

## Transition to Machine Learning

In **March 2020**, I moved from the Backend team to the Machine Learning team, even though I had zero prior professional ML experience.

<br>

I enrolled in [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) courses and gained practical ML knowledge within a month.

## My First Machine Learning Model ðŸš€

Soon after, I developed my first ML model for Price Suggestion. I trained, developed, and deployed it to production in 1.5 months.

```diff
+ Polyaxon
+ Many ML frameworks
```

## (Personal) Hackathon Finalist

In another hackathon, I applied ML and created a WhatsApp bot for fact-checking COVID-19 messages. I became a **finalist** and was offered pre-incubation by an Indian VC firm.

## Image Recognition Project

I worked on maintaining an image recognition project. Despite knowing nothing initially, it became one of the most interesting projects I worked on.

```diff
+ Kubeflow
```

## Reflections

These are just a few highlights of my past two years at Mercari. I always sought out challenging tasks to learn and grow.
