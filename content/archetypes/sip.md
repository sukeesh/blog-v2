## Introduction

I analyzed how much profit or loss one would have made by buying **one unit of stock daily** in the following instruments. These were chosen randomly from the [NIFTY50 Index](https://www1.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/equities_stock_watch.htm).

## Motivation

Burton Malkiel, in his book [*A Random Walk Down Wall Street*](https://amzn.to/2zXGVdu), famously wrote:

> *"A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by the experts."*

This inspired me to test a systematic approach to buying stocks daily.

---

## Assumptions

- For each day, the **average price** (mean of the day's low and high prices) is used as the buy price.
- This accounts for the reality that it's nearly impossible to always buy at the day's lowest price or avoid its highest.

### Key Metrics in Charts

- **Cumulative Cost (Cum Cost):** The total cost of all stocks purchased up to a given day.
- **Cumulative Value (Cum Value):** The current value of all stocks purchased.

## Conclusion

This analysis illustrates the essence of Systematic Investment Plans (SIP):  
Buy consistently and stay invested. Accumulate slowly (not daily ðŸ˜‰) to mitigate market volatility and maximize returns over time.
